## Overview

The challenge is about the creation of a responsive front page

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

## My process

First comparing the model of 1440px and 370px, was to identify the main sections of the page which would be 2 in this case.
One for the upper section and the other for the card section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned in this challenge the use of flexbox, using the align-self to position the items inside the flexbox.
And the use of the background style to add two backgrounds at the same time.
